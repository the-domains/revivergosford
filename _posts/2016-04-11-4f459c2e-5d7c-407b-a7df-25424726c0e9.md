## Brunch has arrived!

One of the projects that we've been working away on for a while has finally come to fruition!  We love our cocktails, and we love our food, whatever time of day it is, so we figured it only made sense that we offered a grown up option for Sunday brunch.

Now we are aware that there are one or two other places on the coast that already offer some pretty solid breakfast offerings, but none of them offered that unique mix that is Southern soul and comfort food matched with unique breakfast cocktails.

So with that in mind we set out to create a unique Southern brunch offering.  We focused on keeping the menu tight, and offering a unique dishes that can each be described as distinctly southern, have lots of flavour and make for a perfect option.

As part of our extensive development of the new dishes, we engaged the services of our own Mr Glenn, who spent a good part of his younger years growing up in south and was instrumental in sourcing the grits for our grits & egg dish.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/74485d35-3aa8-41f4-8f9e-49d8bdd121b7.jpg)

We'll be offering brunch every Sunday from 10am through till 4pm, so even if you sleep in, we'll have you covered!
